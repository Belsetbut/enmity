# Installation guide

You can install Enmity as a tweak or as a sideloaded app.

## Enmity tweak (jailbroken users only)

The tweak is available via our repo at [enmity-mod.github.io/repo](https://enmity-mod.github.io/repo).

## Sideload Enmity

### AltStore

To install Enmity without jailbreaking, you may use AltStore. You can get AltStore [here](https://altstore.io/).

### Installation With AltStore

With AltStore loaded on your device, go to the releases page and download the latest .IPA file for Enmity, which is available [here](https://github.com/enmity-mod/tweak/releases/latest).

You will be asked if you want to download the file. Tap "Download", then open AltStore and navigate to the "My Apps" tab. Tap the "+" in the upper left hand corner and navigate to your Downloads folder in the file picker. Choose Enmity.ipa, which is the file you just downloaded.

You may be asked whether you want to keep or remove app extensions. Select "Remove App Extensions", because sideloading with AltStore breaks the extensions that come with Discord. This way, the broken extensions do not unnecessarily use up any of your available app ID slots.

> [!NOTE]
> App extensions implement Discord features such as:
> 
> - Push notifications
> - Screensharing
> - Sharing things to Discord from other apps
>
> Unfortunately, there is currently no way to get these extensions to work when sideloading using AltStore, so you will not be able to use any of the aforementioned features with Enmity. If you want push notifications, then consider sideloading using something else, such as Feather, KravaSign, or TrollStore if your iOS version supports it.

Wait for AltStore to finish installing Enmity, then exit AltStore. Enmity should now be on your home screen.
